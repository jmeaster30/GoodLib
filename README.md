# MyLib

My C# library with some random stuff in it that I wanted to make my code look a little cleaner or just something that I wanted to try making.

## Contents
- Compression
  - Various compression algorithms that I wanted to try to make.
- DatesAndTimes
  - Extensions that make creating date times look more readable 
  - Timestamp class for DateTimes with timezones.
- Enumerables
  - Enumerable extensions for various things I have needed and some things that just look a lot better than the base C# counterparts
  - BitList for working with bits
- Math
  - Same kind of things as the previous things. Mostly extensions for functions that already exist that make using them look a lot nicer.
- Streams
  - FilteredStream a stream that is filtered lazily
  - ReadTransformStream a stream with data that is transformed as the bytes are read
  - WriteTransformStream a stream with data that is transformed as the bytes are written
  - Various extensions for working with streams that make it easier to work with.
